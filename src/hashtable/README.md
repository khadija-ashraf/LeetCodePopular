# HashTable/ HashMap/ HashSet Patterns:

This is the most common data structure used in the interview questions. Therefore, we have many patterns to cover under the HashTable topic. Below are the pattern categories.

### Frequency Counting

	Use a HashMap or HashSet to count the occurrences of elements. 
 	If input range is smaller then we can use an array for counting the frequencies.
	242. Valid Anagram
	387. First Unique Character in a String
	451. Sort Characters by Frequency
	383. Ransom Note

### Detect Duplicates

	Use a HashSet to check for duplicates.
	217. Contains Duplicate
	219. Contains Duplicate II
	220. Contains Duplicate III

### Two Sum / Complement Lookup

	Use a HashMap to store previously seen numbers and check if their complement exists.
	1. Two Sum
	167. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted (uses two-pointer)
	653. Two Sum IV - Input is a BST

### Group by Frequency / Pattern

	Use a Map<String, List<String>> to group elements by some computed key (e.g., anagram signature).
	49. Group Anagrams
	347. Top K Frequent Elements
	451. Sort Characters by Frequency

### Sliding Window + HashMap

	Use a window to track counts of elements or characters dynamically.
	* 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
	* 76. Minimum Window Substring
	* 567. Permutation in String

### Prefix Sum with HashMap

	Track the sum of elements and use a map to check if a required sum has occurred before.
	560. Subarray Sum Equals K
	974. Subarray Sums Divisible by K
	1248. Count Number of Nice Subarrays

### Custom Hashing / Coordinate Hashing

	Map coordinates, strings, or custom objects to values.
	149. Max Points on a Line
	981. Time Based Key-Value Store
	36. Valid Sudoku

### Simulate Data Structures

	Use hash tables to simulate LRU caches or complex key-value structures.
	146. LRU Cache
	380. Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)
	355. Design Twitter

### Word Pattern Matching
   
	Track character/word mappings using two hash maps or one with value set checks.
	290. Word Pattern
	205. Isomorphic Strings
	890. Find and Replace Pattern

### Pro Tip:

When solving a problem, ask yourself:
* Can I track frequencies?
* Can I use a set to detect duplicates?
* Can I map a key to a value (like index, frequency, etc.)?
* Can I reduce time complexity using hashmap lookups?

    20.	Max Points on a Line
    Find the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line.
