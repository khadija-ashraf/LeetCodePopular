# Backtrack 101

The top classic backtracking problems are, Permutations, Combinations, SubArrays, String Partitioning, Constraints Solving, Unique paths, Grid Paths, so on. Just imaginze, if we nail the fundamental pattern of building a backtracking solution, that is our key to success in coding many more backtracking problems.

In this article, my target is to introduce the fundamental travarsal of backtracking along with the coding pattern. Later in the tutorial, when we get the knack of writing a `basic backtracking function` we will tweak the `basic backtracking function` to solve different problems under the mentioned topics avobe.
